- Need to check for windows compatiblility, currently have Windows 7 (legacy), 8.1 and 10 test systems. No, native code with hipe does not work. Not supported platform.
- Need to write to readme that quit button does not work on Linux and that if it is used it freezes completely and you need to close the terminal launching the application, oh well, at least I was expecting something worse.
- Need to write to readme that "erl -smp" is needed after and erlc or "erlc +native".
